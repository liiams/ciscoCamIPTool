# Cisco Camera - RE-IP tool
Requires python 3 and requests module.

TODO:
Improve exception handling for cameras not on network vs. not responding to HTTP.
Add exception handler for invalid login.
Add DNS setting.

TODO if not too lazy:
Add menu driven system to also allow Camera Initialization settings (ssh, http, https) to be applied, rather than
updating ip addresses.
